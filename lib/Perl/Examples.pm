# ABSTRACT: A collection of various examples of Perl modules/scripts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<EARLY RELEASE, MORE EXAMPLES TO COME, CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME.>

This distribution, as the name suggests, contains a random collection of various
Perl modules/scripts, mostly for testing. Some examples are:

=over

=item * script that generates warning

=item * script that dies

=item * script that contains an endless loop

=item * script that grows indefinitely

=item * module that contains POD examples

=back

As more examples are added they might get reorganized (renamed, spun off to
another dist, etc).
